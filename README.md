PET ADOPTION AND CARE CENTER

Pet Shelter is an online, searchable database of animals who need homes. Organizations maintain their home pages and available-pet databases.

Our mission is to use Internet technology and the resources so that it can lead to:
1.	Increase public awareness of the availability of high-quality adoptable pets.
2.	Increase the overall effectiveness of pet adoption programs across country to the extent that the euthanasia of adoptable pets is eliminated.
3.	Elevate the status of pets to that of family member.

From the comfort of their personal computers, pet lovers can search for a pet that best matches their needs. They can then reference a shelterâ€™s web page and discover what services it offers.
